# Group_Matrix
This application aims to define all the groups possible (size to define) for a list defined.

This app has been created using Python then compiled into an .exe file so a lot of people can use it.

This app ask two data: the list of names & the size of the group. The list of name must not include special caracters as accent or "," which is used as a separator. If you want to use "," please, ask me to add this possibility.

It will automatically generates a .csv file with all the possibility calculated. This file will be saved at the position of the .exe file. The name will start by a timestamp (Date and time of the PC).
